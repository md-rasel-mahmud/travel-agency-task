# TASK

Welcome to my Vite (React) project! This is a brief guide on how to run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v18.18.2 or later)
- npm (v10.7.0 or later)

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using below command using your favorite terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/md-rasel-mahmud/travel-agency-task
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd travel-agency-task
```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start a development server [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and open your default web browser with the project running. Any changes you make to the code will be hot-reloaded, so you can see the changes instantly.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a production-ready build of your project in the `dist` directory.
